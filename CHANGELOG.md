# Changelog

## 1.0.1 (unreleased)

- **Name:** the product is now called **AI Agent Manager**, matching the `ai-agentmanager` package. The command is still `agentmgr`.
- **About:** the version next to the title opens an About box with the release date, author, license, links and this daemon's details; **Check for updates** asks npm for the newest version. `agentmgr about` (`--check`) in a terminal.
- **Dependencies:** DOMPurify 3.4.17, body-parser 2.4.0, Mermaid 12.

## 1.0.0 (2026-10-25)

- **License:** Apache-2.0 (was MIT).
- **Remote access is off until you turn it on** (`agentmgr remote on`). Installs that had it on keep it on.
- **AI judge visibility:** the bottom of the Inbox shows today's calls with **Turn off** / **Turn on**; also `agentmgr judge [on|off]`.
- **Hub:** `agentmgr hub serve` also listens on this Mac's Tailscale address, and **Add machine** gives a join command other machines can reach (or says why they can't).
- **Linux:** a clear message when Chrome's sandbox can't start; `browserNoSandbox` to run without it.
- **Upgrades:** the state file is versioned, backed up at startup, migrated with a backup, and never overwritten by an older version.
- **Plugins:** policies that can refuse actions, audit listeners, extra API routes and engines on the daemon; sign-in methods, request policies and audit on the hub ([docs/plugins.md](docs/plugins.md)).
- **Packaging:** `npm i -g ai-agentmanager` (the command is `agentmgr`), `agentmgr --version`.
- **Installer:** the site's `install.sh` puts the program in `~/.local/share/agentmanager` and never touches `~/.agentmanager`, where your agents and workspaces live. It used to replace that folder.
- **Start at login:** `agentmgr service install` keeps `AGENTMGR_PLUGINS` and `AGENTMGR_HUB_PLUGINS`.
- **UI:** long agent names stay on one line, with the buttons below.
- **Project:** CI on macOS and Linux, SECURITY.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, code of conduct, architecture notes.

## 0.5.0 (2026-10-23)

- **AI judge:** rules decide when to look, a fast model decides what is going on: stuck agents (with a specific nudge), idle screens no rule matched, whether "done" work meets the intent, colliding changes, backlog order and splits, and which alerts interrupt you. Learns from your reactions.
- **CLI sign-in links:** `railway login`, `gh auth login --web` and similar open where the callback reaches the waiting CLI, from any device.
- **Live browser tabs:** a real Chrome on the machine, streamed into the tab, with typing, scrolling, popups as tabs, the phone keyboard, sharp frames on retina screens and one-way sound.
- **Continue terminal sessions:** import Claude Code sessions started with a plain `claude` and continue them as agents.

## 0.4.0 (2026-10-21)

- **Engines:** Codex CLI and Antigravity CLI next to Claude Code, behind one adapter.
- **Browser tabs:** open any address next to an agent's terminals, relayed over HTTPS to signed-in remote devices.
- **Human vs AI** review with a second-model critique; optional plan review before an agent implements.
- **Hub sign-in links:** open a machine's own page signed in, with a one-time ticket.

## 0.3.0 (2026-10-18)

- **Hub:** one place for agents on several machines: fleet view, control, a shared backlog that starts work where there's room, Google sign-in.

## 0.2.0 (2026-10-18)

- **Decision inbox, conflict radar, stuck detection, checkpoints and forks, races.**

## 0.1.x (2026-10-03 to 2026-10-09)

- First release: one background agent per intent, CLI, daemon and web UI, worktrees per agent, briefs, results, phone access, multiple shells and file attachments, swipe to scroll on phones.
